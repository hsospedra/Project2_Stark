# Vanguard A/B Test Analysis

## 🧪 Project Overview

This project analyzes the results of a digital A/B experiment conducted by Vanguard to evaluate whether a redesigned online user interface improves client experience and process completion. The experiment compares a traditional interface (Control group) with a redesigned version (Test group).

The analysis focuses on measuring differences between the Test and Control groups using key performance indicators (KPI) such as completion rate, time spent across process steps, and error-related behavior. These metrics are used to assess whether the redesigned interface leads to a more efficient and intuitive client journey.

In addition to the core experiment evaluation, the project includes exploratory analyses of client demographics and behavior. These analyses examine relationships between client tenure, number of accounts, balances, engagement metrics, and support interactions in order to provide additional context around client behavior and potential secondary effects of the redesign.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository contains the following folders and files:

###  data_raw
Contains the original datasets provided for the project. These raw files are kept unchanged for reference and reproducibility.

###  data_clean
Includes cleaned and processed datasets used for analysis. The cleaning steps applied to the raw data are documented in the notebooks.

###  figures
Contains visual assets generated during the project, including charts from exploratory data analysis, diagrams created in Miro, and Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) used for SQL analysis and database understanding.

###  notebook
Holds the analysis notebooks used in the project. These notebooks contain the code for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, metric calculations, hypothesis testing, and visualizations.
